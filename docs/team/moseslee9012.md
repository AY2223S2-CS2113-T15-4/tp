## Overview: Project Clanki

Clanki is a command line application to store flashcards used for
memorising information and concepts. The user can interact with
the app by typing commands into their terminal.

### Summary of Contributions

**Added feature:** Added `delete` function to remove flashcards

- **Description:** The `delete` allows users to remove a specified
  flashcard from the existing list. Typing "delete" will show the full
  list of existing flashcards, and prompts the user for the index of
  the flashcard to be deleted. The user can include a query, or keyword,
  to find the relevant questions and narrow down the search list.
